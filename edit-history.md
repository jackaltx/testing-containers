Let me summarize the key changes we made to get the build script working:

1. Initial Issue - Permission Denied:
   - First encountered error accessing podman configuration in root's directory
   - Tried to fix by setting up user directories and permissions

2. Configuration Files:
   - Created proper podman configuration structure:
   ```
   ~/.config/containers/
   ├── auth.json
   ├── containers.conf
   ├── registries.conf
   └── registries.conf.d/
   ```
   - Set proper permissions (700 for directories, 600 for auth.json)

3. Podman Approach Change:
   - Major shift from running podman with sudo to rootless podman
   - Simplified script by removing complex sudo handling
   - Verified podman was working correctly as user with `podman version`

4. Ansible Integration:
   - First hit an error with the podman connection plugin
   - Switched to using community.docker.docker connection plugin instead
   - Fixed systemd container configuration in podman run command:
   ```bash
   podman run -d \
       --name test_container \
       --privileged \
       -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
       -p 2222:22 \
       "$CONTAINER_TYPE" \
       /sbin/init
   ```

5. Final Fixes:
   - Updated inventory.yml with proper ansible configuration:
     - Set ansible_remote_tmp to /tmp
     - Enabled pipelining
     - Specified Python interpreter
   - Modified Containerfile to:
     - Install python3-pip
     - Create ansible temp directory with proper permissions
     - Set up systemd correctly

The key learning points were:
1. Rootless podman is preferred over running with sudo
2. Container connections in Ansible need careful configuration for systemd containers
3. Temporary directory permissions are critical for Ansible operations
4. The docker connection plugin can work well with podman containers

Would you like me to show you any specific parts of these changes in more detail?
